Catpipeline is a highly available application to collect as many images of cats in containers. This application uses CI/CD because all new cat images must be seen as soon as possible. Whenever a new commit is added to the repository, AWS CloudWatch Events triggers for the pipeline to update and deploy an updated application. When triggered to deploy, an ECS cluster in Fargate mode is used with 2 tasks and a service. The task definition contains the Docker image stored in ECR to use for each container, 1GB task memory, and 0.5vCPU. The service defines the deployment type of Fargate, auto assigns a public IP, and configured to use an Application Load Balancer. The application is ran on 2 containers, each in a different availability zones that are a part of the target group configured in the Application Load Balancer.
